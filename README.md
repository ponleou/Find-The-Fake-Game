## Overview

"Find the Fake" is a 2D, pixelated, bird's-eye-view game that involves finding the fake NPC among the many NPCs inside the room. Be sure to find the correct one within in the time limit or there will be consequences. This game was built in C/C++ using the SplashKit library. 

The player can move around using WASD and can swing their weapon by pressing SPACE or LEFT CLICK. Players can differentiate the fake NPC with the real NPC through behavioural differenences as the fake NPC will always move away from the player. To complete each level, the player must kill the fake NPC. Furthermore, the player also has a special "focus" ability where when activated, time slows down, and the fake NPC gets highlighed, but your field of vision is reduced. If you kill the wrong NPC, or if you ran out of time, the fake NPC will transform into a monster and hunt you down.
